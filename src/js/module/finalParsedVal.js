/**
 * This module will be used to parse our final value.
 *
 * 4)
 * We need a function that returns what needs to be displayed by the calculator
 * and this should return the final parsed value.
 *
 * This function needs to take a few parameters including:
 *
 * - A key (from keyType.js).
 * - The current number displayed in the UI.
 * - State object which holds the parameters for our logic for which keys are
 * pressed and in what sequence. Depending on the sequence we will do different
 * operations and logic:
 *    - An initial value.
 *    - An operation.
 *    - A modified value.
 *    - Previous key type pressed.
 * If clear is pressed reset the value to 0
 * If the key type is a number...
 * if the key type is a decimal/float...
 * If the key is an operation...
 * If the key is equals...
 * If the key is save...
