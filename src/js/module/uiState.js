/**
 * This module will be used to update out calculators UI.
 *
 * 5)
 * We need a function which can handle all of our custom attirbutes that are
 * going to be set (from parseOperations.js). This will ultimately handle the
 * aesthetics for our UI.
 *
 * This function needs to take a few parameters including:
 *
 * - A Key (from keyType.js)
 * - Using the Calculator dom selector (from domSelectors.js)
 *    - DOMSelector.dataset will be destructured and include
 *      the same values as our state object:
 *      - An initial value.
 *      - An operation.
 *      - A modified value.
 *      - Previous key type pressed.
 * - Our function which handles our operations (from parseOperations.js)
 * - The current number displayed in the UI.
 *
 * If key is an operation...
 * If key is equals...
 * if key is clear...
